3. Describe the difficulties you faced (if any) while working on the challenge and how you tackled them.
    One difficulties I faced was resetting the choices after clicking "retake quiz". After some brainstorming,
    I decided to store a variable that keeps track of when the quiz needs to be resetted. Then, I used 
    useEffect in the QuestionCard to clear the selected choice when the variable changes. Another difficulty 
    I faced was creating the UI. I wanted a clean UI that is not cluttered but I realized that it looked empty
    so I added images and also a progress bar.
